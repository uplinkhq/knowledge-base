# ü§ù Direct Engagement

Once a company finds a suitable freelancer through Uplink, the contract must be concluded directly between the company and freelancer. **Uplink is not part of this contractual relationship.**

There are [contract templates](https://uplink.tech/en/contract-templates) on our website that can be used for a contract with the freelancer.

Accordingly, invoices are then also issued directly by the freelancer to the company during the project. The [fee](../020-freelancers/090-our-fee.md) is handled directly between Uplink and the freelancer.
