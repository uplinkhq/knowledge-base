# ðŸ§­ Guides

Since June 2025, the Uplink team has been supported in our Community Slack by the "Guides". This is a group of dedicated members who support the community, are available to answer questions and solve problems and can also intervene as moderators if necessary.

More background information on the creation of the guides can be found in the announcement blog post:
