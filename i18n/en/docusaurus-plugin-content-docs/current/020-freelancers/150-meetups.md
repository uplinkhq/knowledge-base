# üçª Meetups

As a community we would like to give you, besides exciting projects, a lot of opportunities to network and exchange ideas. We announce every event in our [#announcements](https://uplink.tech/slack/announcements) chanel via slack.

**IPAs & APIs Community Meetup**
Once a month we organize a Community Meetup for you in Berlin. In a cozy atmosphere mostly in a local bar you have the opportunity to network with each other and exchange information about current topics. Up to now, the Meetup has taken place regularly just in Berlin. In the future we are planning to organize these Meetups in all major German cities on a regular basis.
If you are interested in helping to organize a Meetup in your city, please contact us!

**Remote Community Meetups**
Recently we are glad to offer Remote Community Meetups every 14 days. Freelancers from all over the world have the opportunity to meet virtually via Jitsi and talk about current topics. Usually there are some volunteers who give a short lightening talk about the latest technologies or challenges. This is also a relaxed get-together.

**Webinars**
We are trying to offer a webinar on various topics at least once a month. If you can imagine yourself giving a webinar on a particular theme or have an interesting topic that is relevant to the community, please contact us. We will then look together how your idea can be realized.
