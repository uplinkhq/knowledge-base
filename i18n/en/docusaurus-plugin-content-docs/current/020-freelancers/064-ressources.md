## Additions and changes

Is an entry no longer up to date, or would you like to add a new entry?

The easiest way to do this is to edit this page directly on GitHub. To do so, click on the "Edit this page" link at the bottom of this page.

If you have never worked with GitHub before, don't panic – it's very easy, you just need to create a GitHub account, but otherwise you don't need to download or install anything. Just follow [these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/editing-files).
