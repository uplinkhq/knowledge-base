# ðŸ¤— Joining Uplink

Membership in Uplink is free and the only way to join is to [apply via our website](https://uplink.tech/en#apply).

We check all new applications every couple of days and either create an account (in which case you will receive a welcome email and a separate invite email to our Slack workspace) or send you a mail with follow-up questions.

## Requirements

Uplink is a network of Germany-based IT freelancers, so the requirements are:

* You are based in Germany, or you have definite plans to move here within the next few months.
* You are a freelancer. It doesn't matter whether you are simply selbststÃ¤ndig, have your own UG/GmbH or have a company with a couple of colleagues. We don't accept agencies with more than a few people, though.
* You work in IT. The most common roles of our members are Software Developer, DevOps Engineer,  Interim-CTO, Data Scientist, Scrum Master, or Agile Coach.
