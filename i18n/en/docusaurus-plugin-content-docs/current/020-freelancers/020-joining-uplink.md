# ðŸ¤— Joining Uplink

Membership in Uplink is free and you can easily [apply via our website](https://uplink.tech/freelancers#apply).

We review all new applications within a few days. You'll then either receive a welcome email and a separate invitation to our [Community Slack](060-community-slack.md), or we'll contact you via email with follow-up questions if anything needs clarification.

## Requirements

Uplink is a network for IT freelancers in the DACH region.<br/>
Requirements for membership are therefore:

* Your permanent residence is in Germany, Austria, or Switzerland.
* You are a freelancer - it doesn't matter whether you're self-employed or have your own UG or GmbH. Small freelancer teams operating under their own name are also very welcome! However, we don't accept "real" agencies or service providers.
* You work in the IT field. We define this quite broadly though - in addition to classic tech roles, designers, marketers, and "product" people are also welcome with us.
