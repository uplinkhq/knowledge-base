# 🧑‍💻 Uplink for Freelancers

There are many freelancer networks, job boards and other ways for freelancers to find new projects or connect to their peers. Why should you join Uplink?

**Our aim is to offer so many useful services to Germany-based IT freelancers that it doesn't make sense to NOT be a member of Uplink! 😄**

* Our [direct jobs](040-direct-jobs.md) let you work directly with a client, no middleman involved.
* Our [recruiter jobs](050-recruiter-jobs.md) let you discover jobs from recruiters without the usual fluff.
* Our [Slack](060-community-slack.md) lets you talk directly to hundreds of other IT freelancers about the topics that matter to you.
* Our [webinars](170-webinars.md) bring you expert knowledge to your home and you can actively participate.
