# ðŸ¤  Recruiter Jobs

Unlike [direct jobs](040-direct-jobs.md), recruiter jobs are not posted by the Uplink team, but by one of our recruiting partners. These are selected recruiters and agencies who can independently post their jobs on our platform and speak with candidates who apply. However, like our end customers for direct jobs, they do not have direct access to our Slack or our members' profiles.

Since November 1, 2021, there is no fee for recruiter jobs. Before that date, we charged the freelancer a 3% fee for the first 6 months of cooperation with the end customer.

When a member applies for a recruiter job and an interview with the recruiter is set up, the rest of the process is directly between the freelancer and the recruiter. The recruiter introduces the freelancer to the end customer and takes care of the further application and interview process. The contract is then also concluded directly between the freelancer and the recruiter.
